# First-Year Women in Coding Mentorship Program

## Mission
To empower first-year female students pursuing computer science by connecting them with supportive upperclassmen mentors and industry professionals, fostering confidence, skill development, and community.

## Goals
- Provide a structured, one-on-one mentorship experience that bridges the gap between academic learning and real-world practice.
- Build a supportive network that encourages persistence in STEM fields.
- Equip mentees with the technical, professional, and personal skills needed to thrive in their academic and early career journeys.
- Create meaningful leadership opportunities for upperclassmen and industry volunteers.

## Who Is This For?
- **First-year female students** (mentees) who are enrolled in computer science or related programs and want guidance, encouragement, and insight from more experienced peers.
- **Upperclassmen (sophomores, juniors, seniors)** and **industry professionals** (mentors) who are passionate about gender diversity in tech and wish to give back by sharing their knowledge and experience.

## How It Works
1. **Apply** – Mentees and mentors fill out a short application form (linked below) to express their interests, background, and availability.
2. **Match** – The program coordinators use a transparent rubric to pair mentees with mentors based on shared interests, goals, and schedules.
3. **Engage** – Matched pairs meet regularly (virtually or in person) for at least one academic semester, following the program guidelines outlined in [GUIDELINES.md](./GUIDELINES.md).
4. **Grow** – Both mentors and mentees participate in optional community events, workshops, and check-ins organized by the program.

## Repository Structure
This repository serves as the central hub for all program materials, including:
- Program guidelines and expectations ([GUIDELINES.md](./GUIDELINES.md))
- A welcoming and inclusive [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Application forms, matching rubrics, and other planning documents (to be added)
- Issue tracker for program tasks, discussions, and improvements
